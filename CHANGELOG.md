### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.0:

#### Import Changes
```python
# Old (still works via backward compatibility)
from excel_translate import ExcelTranslatorV2

# New (recommended)
from offitrans import ExcelProcessor
```

#### Configuration Changes
```python
# Old
translator = ExcelTranslatorV2(max_workers=5)

# New
from offitrans.core.config import Config
config = Config()
config.translator.max_workers = 5
processor = ExcelProcessor(config=config)
```

#### API Changes
Most existing code will continue to work due to backward compatibility aliases, but we recommend migrating to the new API for better features and performance.

### Breaking Changes

- **Import paths**: While backward compatibility is maintained, the recommended import paths have changed
- **Configuration system**: New centralized configuration system (old parameters still work)
- **Exception types**: New exception hierarchy (old exceptions are still raised for compatibility)

### Deprecations

- Direct parameter passing to processors (use Config instead)
- Old import paths (will be removed in v1.0.0)
- Legacy function names (use new processor classes)

### Support

- **Python versions**: 3.7+ (dropped support for 3.6)
- **Dependencies**: Updated minimum versions for security and compatibility
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
