# TODO List - Offitrans Project Optimization

This document tracks optimization tasks and technical improvements for the Offitrans project.

## High Priority - Security & Stability

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues
- [√] **Fix critical security vulnerability**: API keys exposed in examples and potentially logged
- [x] **Add input validation and sanitization**: Implement comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling and logging**: Create unified error handling mechanism throughout the codebase

### 🔧 Code Quality & Type Safety
- [ ] **Add comprehensive type hints**: Fix mypy violations across all modules
- [ ] **Refactor large functions and classes**: Follow single responsibility principle for better maintainability

## Performance Optimization

### ⚡ Core Performance
- [ ] **Optimize translation caching mechanism**: Improve performance and memory usage efficiency
- [ ] **Implement async/await pattern**: Replace threading with async for concurrent API calls
- [ ] **Optimize memory usage for large documents**: Reduce memory footprint during processing
- [ ] **Add rate limiting and retry mechanisms**: Improve API call reliability and prevent rate limit violations

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- [ ] **Add configuration validation**: Implement proper validation and default value handling
- [ ] **Implement resource cleanup**: Add context managers for file operations and proper resource management

## Testing & Coverage

### 🧪 Test Improvements
- [ ] **Improve test coverage**: Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] **Add integration tests**: Ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly
- [ ] **Add performance benchmarks**: Track performance improvements over time

## Documentation & Examples

### 📚 Documentation Tasks
- [ ] **Update API documentation**: Ensure all public APIs are properly documented
- [ ] **Improve example security**: Remove hardcoded API keys from examples
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions

## Priority Legend
- 🚨 **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities and data safety issues
- ⚡ **High**: Performance and stability improvements
- 🔧 **Medium**: Code quality and maintainability
- 🧪 **Low**: Testing and documentation improvements

## Notes
- Tasks are organized by priority and category
- Security issues should be addressed first
- Performance optimizations can be tackled in parallel
- Regular code review should be conducted after each major change
